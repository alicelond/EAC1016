Here are the assignments developed during the 'Vibration Control' (EAC1016) course.

All files will be written in Portuguese and coding may be written in Python or MatLab.

- Controle_de_Vibrações_Trabalho_5: this archive shows the variation of the transmissibility of a system with one degree of freedom, and the variation of the resonant frequency ratio in relation to the mass ratio;
- DampingFactor: this archive calculates damping factor using the half-power bandwidth method.
